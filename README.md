ðŸ’¡ With its intuitive interface, you can easily input audio or text files and have the tool automatically generate a corresponding lip sync animation. You can also customize the animation by adjusting the mouth shape and timing for your 3D or 2D characters.

ðŸŽ® The tool uses advanced AI algorithms to automatically generate facial animations that match the timing and tone of your character's speech, freeing you up to focus on other aspects of your project.

Whether you're creating a game, an animated film, or any other type of interactive content, Gepetto is a powerful tool that can help you bring your characters to life.
